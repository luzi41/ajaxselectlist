.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
----------------

This extension provides a drop-down list which uses Ajax to load records into the page without reloading the website.

- potential uses: for instance listing of **employees** or **branch stores**
- use title, richtext and multimedia assets (images, videos, ...)
- support of both RTE extensions (rtehtmlarea and rte_ckeditor)
- multilanguage support
- based on Extbase and Fluid
- easy installation
- fully functional, but basic Fluid templates without further styling, **because:**
- **the templates are meant for customization! Simply adapt them to your specific design and needs.**
- depends on jQuery (the Ajax request could be rewritten to vanilla JavaScript, though)
