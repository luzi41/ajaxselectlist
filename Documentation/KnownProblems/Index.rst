Known Problems
==============

- | Currently the ``PAGE`` object's **typeNum** can't be set with the existing TypoScript constant.
  | Using the constant would result in the following error although the typeNum is set correctly in the *TypoScript Object Browser*:
  | *#1294587217: The page is not configured! [type=427590][]. This means that there is no TypoScript object of type PAGE with typeNum=427590 configured.*
